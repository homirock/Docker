1. What is Docker?
platform for consistently building running and shipping application.

if ur application running on ur machine. it cause some problems
-one or more files and not included in the part of deployment.then application will not start.
-software version mismatching (if your apps need go1.20 but your machine having go version 1.18)
-Differnt configuration setting like env variable is different across the machine.

thats why docker comes into picture.

In docker you can package you apps along with required depencies(db,go).
Benefits-->
-lets say one application need go1.16 and another application need go.1.20 the using docker compose we ccan run 2 container side by side.

-lets say we want to delete any application and its dependencies. then there might not be any probabilty of deleteing other files by mistake. we just have to do 
docker compose down --rmi all
2.Virtual machine vs container
container is an isolated environment for running an application. 
VM -- abstraction of a machine..we can run run several VM on a real physical machine. for example we can run windows and linux in mac using a tool called hypervisor.
hypervisor is a software to create and manage virtual machines.
example of hypervisors-Virtual box, vmware, HyperV(windows only)
